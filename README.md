# Traffic-Signal-Management-with-Thread-Synchronization-

In this project I have Modelled a common roadway occurrence, where one lane is closed and a flag person is directing traffic. 
On one side of the road there is some construction work is going on so all the vehicles coming from north and south direction has 
to synchronise such that they pass through the construction area without any traffic jam or accident.                                                                       
This simulation utilises synchronisation mechanisms like mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores to coordinate threads efficiently. 
It prevents potential race conditions by safeguarding shared data structures with mutexes and ensures proper car generation through a 
semaphore-based mechanism. In this project we have  also employed a condition variable to manage the flag person's state and utilises proper 
sleep functions for delay. So basically The project's strengths lie in its effective synchronisation implementation, ensuring thread safety, 
controlled car production, and flag person coordination. Overall, the project showcases a valuable application of synchronisation techniques in a 
real-world traffic management scenario.
